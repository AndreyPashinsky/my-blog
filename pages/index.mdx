## Andrey Pashinsky

Hey, I am a self-taught **Frontend Developer** zealous about creating tools and features to ensure 
maximum performance with a top-notch user experience. Highly passionate about Web 3.0 and decentralization of social media, finance, and government.  

Previously, I was a professional yoga and movement teacher. 
The ability to stay focused I developed through yoga practice and meditation now helps me in learning never-ending process and solving problems as a software engineer.

I use **React**, **Next.js**, **JavaScript ES6+**, **HTML5**, **CSS3**, **Tailwind**, **Figma**, **Git**
